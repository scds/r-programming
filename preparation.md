# Workshop preparation 

Preparation for this tutorial consists of two steps: [Getting the code](#get-the-code) and [getting the software](#get-the-software). Follow the steps below. 

## Get the code

This workshop uses two pieces of code: [Gen-Data.R](https://github.com/scds/r-programming/blob/dc6c2a569162dc08bede94f77385cf75207de1cd/assets/docs/gen-data.R) and [Workshop-File.R](https://github.com/scds/r-programming/blob/dc6c2a569162dc08bede94f77385cf75207de1cd/assets/docs/workshop-file.R)

## Get the software
This hands-on workshop uses [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), a software application for data analysis. We ask that you download R in advance of the workshop to be able to participate in it to the fullest extent.

You can download R for free on the [official R website](https://www.r-project.org/).
